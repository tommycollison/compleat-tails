## Tails: A Complete Guide 

### Introduction 

> "[Tails] has been an essential tool for reporting the NSA story. It is an all-in-one secure digital communication system (GPG email, OTR chat, Tor web browser, encrypted storage) that is small enough to swallow."
> â€” Laura Poitras, Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker and board member with Freedom of the Press Foundation.

Software is said to be either "open-source" or "closed-source," depending on whether security researchers and independent auditors can look at the code, see what it does, and make sure that nothing untoward is happening. 

Mac OS X and Windows are examples of closed-source operating systems. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, has [claimed](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) that the U.S. government doesn't have backdoor access to Apple products, but since we can't look at the code ourselves, we're forced to take his word for it. Linux systems such as [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) or [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) are open-source alternatives to Mac and Windows.

In 2009, the Tails operating system (OS) was released. Essentially, it's a version of Linux that's been modified to enhance user privacy and anonymity. It's currently the gold standard for secure, anonymous computer use, and was crucial to Ed Snowden when he worked with Freedom of the Press board-members Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras to reveal NSA overreach.

As their site [explains](https://tails.boum.org), Tails helps you:

> - use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship; all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network;
> - leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly;
> - use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.

Every part of Tails is designed to strengthen the user's security. For instance, the system wipes itself clean every time you power down so that if your system is compromised by malware during one browsing session, it's gone the next time you boot up. 

This is possible because the OS runs on an external storage device -- a USB stick or a DVD. Most computers store the OS on an internal hard-drive, which makes them easier for malware and other malicious code to compromise them. Because Tails wipes itself clean every time you power down, there's nowhere for viruses to persist.
