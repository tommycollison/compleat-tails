## Tails: A Complete Guide 

### Creating PGP Keys

GnuPG (also known as PGP or GPG) is free software you can use to encrypt your email messages and other files on your computer. Tails encrypts your files by default, but PGP encryption is useful if you want to email those files or store them somewhere else. 

This chapter assumes you know about public and private keys. For more information, check out the PGP section of Encryption Works. <link goes here> Before going much further, you should also have Persistence installed.

#### Setup 

On the Tails desktop, there's a clipboard icon in the top right corner. From there, you can access a drop-down menu and manage your keys. If you click on GnuPG keys, you'll see that Tails already has the public keys of the Tails team, so you can securely contact the developers with questions or bug reports.

From here, we're going to create a set of PGP keys
